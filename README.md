# LinkedIn Post Generator

This project helps preprocess and analyze LinkedIn posts using **LangChain** and **Groqâ€™s LLaMA 3.3 70B Versatile** model.  
It extracts metadata (line count, language, tags), unifies tags, and prepares posts for further use.  
The project also provides a **Streamlit UI** for running the pipeline interactively.
